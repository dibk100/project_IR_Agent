      "   - Normalize or standardize the features using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing: `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler; scaler = StandardScaler(); data[features] = scaler.fit_transform(data[features])`. This step ensures equal contribution of each feature to the model performance.\n",
      "   - Handle outliers by removing them using the Winsorize method from the scikit-survival library. This method replaces extreme values with a specified percentile (e.g., 99.9%). `from scikits.survival import Winsorizer; winsorizer = Winsorizer(percentile=99.9); data[features] = winsorizer.fit_transform(data[features])`.

      "################# 3. ACT Îã®Í≥Ñ(Model AgentÎ™®Îç∏ ÏàòÌñâ) execute_plan Ìï®Ïàò : To find the top-3 high-performance models for the given dataset using the specified Logistic Regression model as the initial model, follow these detailed steps for modeling and optimization:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Retrieve high-performance models**:\n",
      "   - Initialize the Logistic Regression model using the provided source (local) and fit the model with the training data.\n",
      "   - Train additional classical machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)) using the same training data and evaluate their performance for comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Hyperparameter optimization**:\n",
      "   - For the Logistic Regression model, optimize the following hyperparameters:\n",
      "     - `C`: Regularization parameter. It controls the trade-off between fitting the training data and preventing overfitting. A larger value of `C` results in a stricter penalty on the model's complexity, which may lead to underfitting. A smaller value of `C` allows for a more complex model, which may lead to overfitting. The optimal value for `C` depends on the dataset and the severity of the classification problem. For this dataset, we can try a range of values like [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100].\n",
      "   - For the Random Forest model, optimize the following hyperparameters:\n",
      "     - `n_estimators`: The number of trees in the forest. A larger number of trees may lead to better performance but increased training time and overfitting. A smaller number of trees may lead to underfitting. For this dataset, we can try a range of values like [50, 100, 200, 500, 1000].\n",
      "     - `max_depth`: The maximum depth of a tree. A larger depth allows for a more complex tree, which may lead to overfitting. A smaller depth may lead to underfitting. For this dataset, we can try a range of values like [5, 10, 20, 50, 100].\n",
      "   - For the GBM model, optimize the following hyperparameters:\n",
      "     - `n_estimators`: The number of boosting stages. A larger number of boosting stages may lead to better performance but increased training time and overfitting. A smaller number of boosting stages may lead to underfitting. For this dataset, we can try a range of values like [50, 100, 200, 500, 1000].\n",
      "     - `learning_rate`: The shrinkage factor that controls the contribution of each tree to the final model. A larger learning rate may lead to overfitting, while a smaller learning rate may lead to underfitting. For this dataset, we can try a range of values like [0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0].\n",
      "   - For the SVM model, optimize the following hyperparameters:\n",
      "     - `C`: The penalty parameter for the error term. A larger value of `C` results in a stricter penalty on the model's complexity, which may lead to underfitting. A smaller value of `C` allows for a more complex model, which may lead to overfitting. For this dataset, we can try a range of values like [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100].\n",
      "     - `gamma`: The kernel coefficient that controls the influence of nearby training examples. A larger value of `gamma` gives more weight to nearby examples, while a smaller value gives more weight to distant examples. For this dataset, we can try a range of values like [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100].\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Extract and understand the underlying characteristics of the dataset(s)**:\n",
      "   - This step is not directly related to the modeling part and should be performed by a data scientist or data analyst. However, it is essential to understand the dataset's characteristics to select appropriate models and optimize their hyperparameters effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Select top-k models or algorithms**:\n",
      "   - Evaluate the performance of each model using the specified accuracy metric (0.9) as the primary metric on the validation set.\n",
      "   - Select the top-3 models with the highest accuracy based on the user's preference (e.g., k=3).\n",
      "\n",
      "The three candidate models/algorithms potentially to be the optimal models are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Logistic Regression:\n",
      "   - Number of parameters: `(number_of_features + 1)`\n",
      "   - FLOPs: `O(number_of_features * number_of_samples)` for training and `O(number_of_features)` for inference\n",
      "   - Model size: `O(number_of_features)`\n",
      "   - Training time: Depends on the number of features, samples, and the optimization algorithm used\n",
      "   - Inference speed: Fast, as it requires only linear algebra operations\n",

      "2. Random Forest:\n",
      "   - Number of parameters: `(number_of_features * number_of_trees)`\n",

      "   - Model size: `O(number_of_features * number_of_trees)`\n",
      "   - Training time: Depends on the number of features, samples, trees, and the optimization algorithm used\n",
      "   - Inference speed: Moderate, as it requires multiple decision trees to be evaluated\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):\n",
      "   - Number of parameters: `(number_of_features * number_of_trees)`\n",
